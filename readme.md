# BCOG-Final-Project
1.  This project will be based on the Stroop Task. The stroop task is a psychological test used to measure attention and processing speed. Users will be shown color words like "red" or "blue" which will be displayed in matching or mismatched font colors. The user must identify the color of the text, not the word itself. This code should measure the user's response times and accuracy across multiple trials to analyze their cognitive interference and automatic responses.
  2.

   a. This would require using a random module to generate trials with randomized color and word pairings. This would allow pairs like the word red in blue font or the word pink in green font.

   b. It would also require the code to measure how long the user took to respond by measuring the tiime before the user presses a button. 

   c. Finally, it would need to take this data and calculate a summary with statistics like average reaction time(for congruent vs. incongruent trials), and their overall accuracy to display their performance.
